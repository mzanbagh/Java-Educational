# Java Programming Educational Application
<p>This Java program is built with the intention to showcase the fundamentals of core Java programming language and how Java can be easy to learn, and one can start using java very quickly using the concepts covered in this tutorial. <p>

<p>In this program basic concepts of Java are covered at the basic level to showcase the different functionalities of Java. Concepts covered in this application are:

+ Java Variable
+ Data Type
+ Operator
+ if...else
+ Switch
+ Arrays

Java is Platform Independent, and it is a Structured Programming Language meaning not only it can run on any device (with minimal preperation), but we can use utilize Object-Oriented Concepts in Java similarly to any other Structured programming languages like C++, or Python. 
<p>Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is straightforward to Implement and simple to scale while easy to Maintan and debug; that is why industry prefares OOP over other types of programming concepts. <p>

>This Program covers some of the basic concepts, and good practices of Object-Oriented Programming such as:
>>**Class**; is used to create object, acting as a blueprint to create objects.
>
>>**Object**; is an instance of a class.
>
>>**Attribute**; is a variable within a class and can be accesed by object.
>
>>**Method**; is used to operate and perform task.
>
>>**Constructor**; is used to initialize objects with any intial values.

<p> This brief Introduction covered fundamentals of Java Programming language. Java is a platform independent Object-Oriented Programming Language used to develop Desktop, Mobile, and Web apps with high capabilities to match various needs. Java is the number one programming language used in the industry by computer scientis and I definetly enjoy investing my time to advance Java topics and collaborate to share and enhance my knowldege.
